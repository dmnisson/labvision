# labvision
A tool for comparing students' laboratory results in a classroom with accepted or theoretical values, and analyzing error statistics of groups and individuals in groups.

Students will be able to:

* Report their measurement results and uncertainties to their instructors
* See the results of previous experiments
* Analyze the errors in past experiments and compare their results with accepted values
* Submit detailed lab reports in PDF or Word format to instructors for scoring
* See the scores of past lab reports for each course

Instructors will be able to:

* Design experiments with parameters to be adjusted and measurements to be obtained, and optionally set accepted values for obtained results
* Compute results from students' measurements using an entered formula and compare it to students' obtained results
* See results of all students and analyze deviations from accepted values classroom-wide
* Retrieve submitted lab reports and score them using either a numeric system of points or a letter grade
